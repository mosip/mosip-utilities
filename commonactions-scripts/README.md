# Title Comes Here

## Overview /Introduction /About

This is a sample Readme template that can be used by developers to introduce the readers about what the repository/directory would contain.

## Built With 

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. 

Here are a few examples:
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. Hoever, no one template will serve all projects/requirements since your needs may be different.

### Pre-requisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* npm

`npm install npm@latest -g`

## Installation

Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services.

1. Get a free API Key at https://example.com
2. Clone the repo

    `git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git'`
   
3. Install NPM packages
   
    `npm install`

4. Enter your API in `config.js`

    `const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API'`
